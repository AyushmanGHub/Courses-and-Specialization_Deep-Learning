## üßæ About the Specialization
The **TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate**, created by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), is a 4-course specialization designed to help learners build and train **neural networks using TensorFlow**.  
It covers both foundational and advanced deep learning concepts, enabling learners to apply AI/ML solutions to real-world tasks like **computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting**.


## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Technologies Learned
By completing this specialization, I gained hands-on experience in:

- **TensorFlow & Keras API** for deep learning model development  
- Building and training **neural networks** from scratch  
- **Computer Vision**: CNNs, image classification, transfer learning, data augmentation  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: tokenization, embeddings, LSTMs, text classification  
- **Time Series Forecasting** using RNNs, LSTMs, and 1D CNNs  
- **Deployment** of ML models with TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite  
- Understanding of optimization techniques like learning rate scheduling, dropout, and regularization
